# Quick Bite Food Delivery App: Design Process

Our design journey for Quick Bite followed a user-centered and iterative approach, ensuring that every decision was grounded in user needs and validated through testing.

## 1. User Research & Information Architecture

* **Phase Goal:** Understand user behaviors, pain points, and define the app's foundational structure.
* **Methods Applied:**
    * **User Interviews:** To gather qualitative insights into current food ordering habits, frustrations, and desires.
    * **Competitive Analysis:** Studied existing food delivery apps to identify industry best practices and areas for differentiation.
    * **Persona Creation:** Developed detailed user personas (e.g., "Busy Professional," "Health-Conscious Student") to guide design decisions.
* **Key Insights from Research:** Users prioritize speed, clarity, diverse options, and reliable order tracking. Checkout friction and overwhelming choices were common pain points.
* **Information Architecture (IA):**
    * **Card Sorting:** Used to determine intuitive categorization of cuisines and menu items.
    * **User Flows:** Mapped out critical user journeys (e.g., first-time order, re-ordering, searching for specific food) to ensure logical progression.
    * **Wireframing:** Created low-fidelity wireframes for key screens to establish layout and basic functionality before visual design.

## 2. Prototyping & UI Design

* **Phase Goal:** Translate insights into a tangible, visually appealing, and interactive user interface.
* **Design System Definition:**
    * **Typography:** Selected a clean, readable sans-serif font family with a defined typographic scale for hierarchy.
    * **Color Palette:** Chosen to be appetizing and energetic (e.g., vibrant primary, fresh secondary), with strict adherence to WCAG accessibility standards for contrast.
    * **UI Components:** Designed a comprehensive library of reusable components (buttons, input fields, cards, navigation) with all states for consistency.
* **UI Design Principles:**
    * **Mobile-First:** Designed primarily for smartphone users, ensuring optimal touch target sizes and content prioritization.
    * **Clarity & Simplicity:** Emphasized ample white space and clear visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load.
    * **Accessibility:** Ensured high color contrast, readable text, and logical element ordering for all users.
* **Prototyping:**
    * **Tool:** Figma was used to create high-fidelity, interactive prototypes simulating real user interactions for key flows.
    * **Purpose:** Allowed for early validation of design concepts and interactive elements.

## 3. Usability Testing & Iteration

* **Phase Goal:** Validate the design with real users, identify pain points, and iterate for improvement.
* **Testing Methods Applied:**
    * **Moderated Remote Usability Testing:** Observed users completing tasks, gathered qualitative feedback on challenges and preferences.
    * **Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing:** Collected quantitative data on task success rates and completion times.
    * **First-Click Testing:** Assessed intuitiveness of navigation.
* **Most Common Usability Issues Found:**
    * Checkout flow friction (confusion in payment/address steps).
    * Overwhelming search/filter options.
    * Lack of clear visual feedback for certain actions.
    * Complexity in dish customization.
* **User Feedback Impact & Design Iteration:**
    * **Checkout Streamlining:** Consolidated steps, added progress indicators based on feedback.
    * **Enhanced Filters:** Redesigned filter UI for better clarity and efficiency.
    * **Improved Micro-interactions:** Added more noticeable visual cues for actions (e.g., add-to-cart confirmation).
    * **Continuous Refinement:** Each round of testing led to direct design modifications, moving closer to an optimal user experience.

## 4. Tools Used

* **Design & Prototyping:** Figma
* **User Research:** User interviews, competitive analysis
* **Testing:** UsabilityHub (for First-Click, Five-Second Test), custom scripts for moderated sessions
